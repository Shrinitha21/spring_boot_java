## Spring Boot Overview

Spring Boot is an open-source framework used to create microservices and standalone applications. It simplifies the setup, configuration, and development process by providing defaults for code and annotation configuration.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Spring Boot application with a REST API for managing students. It includes features such as database integration, JPA, dependency injection, and more.

## Spring Initializr

Spring Initializr is a web-based tool that helps you bootstrap a new Spring Boot project with a variety of dependencies. Visit [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to generate your project and download the ZIP file.

## IntelliJ

IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for Java development. Import your Spring Boot project into IntelliJ IDEA to start coding.

## Starting The Server

To start the Spring Boot server, run the `main` method in your `Application` class. This will start the embedded Tomcat server and deploy your application.

## Simple API with Spring Boot

Create a simple REST API using Spring Boot. Define a controller with request mappings to handle HTTP requests.

## Student Class

Define a `Student` class with fields such as `id`, `name`, and `email`. Use Lombok annotations or standard Java getters and setters.

## API Layer

Create a REST controller in the API layer to handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate them to the business layer.

## Business Layer

Implement business logic in the service layer. This layer handles the core functionality of the application.

## Dependency Injection

Use Spring's dependency injection to manage bean creation and dependencies within your application. Annotate your classes with `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Autowired` to enable this feature.

## Properties file

Configure your application using the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. Define database connection settings, server ports, and other configuration properties.

## Creating and Connecting to Database

Set up a database (e.g., H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and configure the connection in your properties file. Use Spring Data JPA to interact with the database.

## JPA and @Entity

Annotate your `Student` class with `@Entity` to indicate that it is a JPA entity. Define primary keys using `@Id` and configure fields with `@Column`.

## JPA in Action

Implement CRUD operations using JPA repositories. Create, read, update, and delete student records in the database.

## JPA Repository

Define a repository interface for the `Student` entity by extending `JpaRepository`. This interface provides methods for common database operations.

## Saving Students

Use the repository to save student entities to the database. Implement methods in the service layer to handle saving new students.

## @Transient

Use the `@Transient` annotation to mark fields that should not be persisted in the database. This is useful for fields that are only used temporarily.

## Post Mapping

Define a POST mapping in your controller to handle HTTP POST requests for creating new students. Use `@RequestBody` to bind request data to your `Student` object.

## Writing Business Logic

Implement the business logic for your application in the service layer. This includes validation, processing, and other core functionalities.

## Deleting Students

Add methods to handle deleting students from the database. Implement DELETE mappings in your controller and corresponding service methods.

## Solution

Summarize the solutions and features implemented in your application. Highlight key functionalities and how they address the project requirements.

## Testing

Write unit and integration tests for your application. Use Spring Boot Test, JUnit, and Mockito to test your controllers, services, and repositories.

## Packaging and Running Application

Package your Spring Boot application as a JAR file using Maven or Gradle. Run the application using the `java -jar` command.
