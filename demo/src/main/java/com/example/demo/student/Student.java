@Entity //This is for hibernate, Entity Annotation: @Entity tells JPA that this class is an entity.
@Table //This is for table in database
/***The @Table annotation provides a way to specify the table name, schema, catalog, unique constraints,
 and indexes for a JPA entity. It enhances the mapping between the entity class and the database table,
 allowing for detailed customization and optimization of the database schema as it relates to the entity.***/

     The @SequenceGenerator annotation in Java is used in the context of Java Persistence API (JPA) to define a primary key generator that uses a database sequence. A sequence is a database object that generates a series of unique numbers, which can be used for primary key values.
     Key Points
     Name: The name of the sequence generator.
     Sequence Name: The name of the database sequence object.
     Initial Value: The initial value for the sequence.
     Allocation Size: The increment size for the sequence.

     * he @GeneratedValue annotation specifies how primary key values are generated for an entity.

     Serialization: Itâ€™s also used to prevent fields from being serialized if the entity implements Serializable.***/
